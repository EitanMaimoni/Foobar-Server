Facebook Server Project Overview:
We established the server environment initially by installing dependencies and writing basic code. Then, we integrated the server with the client interface, focusing on API endpoint development and client-side logic, ensuring seamless data flow between them.

How to Run It:
To run both the server and client on your computer:

Clone the repository.
Go to "Production" branch.
Install dependencies using 'npm install'.
Simply use 'npm start' to run both server and client, as the client build is on the server.
Access the application at http://localhost:12345.
You can create a new user or use the built-in user credentials (username: "a", password: "a") for the full experience.
